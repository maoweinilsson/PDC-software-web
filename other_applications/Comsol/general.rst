How to use Comsol on PDC machines
=================================
KTH has a site license for Comsol Multiphysics and almost all the modules that students and employees at KTH can use for academic work. PDC users outside KTH cannot use Comsol unless they supply their own license - to run a cluster simulation you need to own a floating network license.

To see which versions of comsol are installed on any of the machines at PDC log into the machine and type

.. code-block:: bash

 module avail comsol
