DOCK is academic software developed over many years by investigators in Tack Kuntz’s lab, and for
DOCK3.5 derivatives by the Shoichet group. Like any docking program, it has substantial liabilities—it undersamples
degrees of freedom, treats receptor flexibility poorly, and its scoring function is crude, making it prone
to both false-positives and false-negatives. It can neither predict true binding affinities nor can it even reliably
rank order compounds. What it can do, in favorable circumstances, is enrich likely ligands from very large
molecular databases, prioritizing those that are likely to bind for experimental testing. Its most solid support
comes from the papers that have been published showing its utility. The most convincing of these are those
where DOCK screens for novel ligands, these are tested experimentally, and the binding modes of the new
ligands are compared to subsequently determined x-ray crystal structures.
