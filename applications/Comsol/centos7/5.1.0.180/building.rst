Building Comsol on Tegnér is quite straightforward. There is a graphical installer, so make sure that you ssh into Tegnér with the -Y flag. From thereon it is just a matter of choosing a suitable install directory, either in cfs or afs, and following the instructions. Do note that the full installation requires around 6GB of available space, and might thus be more suitable to install in cfs.
