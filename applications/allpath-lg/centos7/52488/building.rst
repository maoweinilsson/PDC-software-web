Allpath-LG is exclusively compiled with GNU CC.
Also, new versions crave GCC version > 4.7.
Although version 5.1 created errors upon compilation, and
therefore allpath-LG was compiled with the default
GNU CC compiler namely 4.8.3

To compile::

  $ ./configure ./configure --prefix=/afs/pdc.kth.se/pdc/vol/allpaths-lg/52488/amd64_co7/bin
  $ make
  $ make install
  
**NOTE** Allpath-LG is quite a large software, and after installation 11.2 GBytes were used.
