**Mathematica is installed on several of PDC's machines. In order to use Mathematica you need a licenses.**

General usage
-------------

In order to use Mathematica you need to have a Mathematica license. In order to start Mathematica you first need to pick the version you want and load that module, for instance:

.. code-block:: bash

 module avail mathematica
 module add mathematica/latest

Mathematica should not be run using the graphical interface since you will be running on compute nodes (which don't have a screen attached...).

If you you want to run in batch mode you do:

.. code-block:: bash

  mathematica -nojvm -nosplash -nodesktop < input.m > output.out

where input.m is your instructions to Mathematica and output.out will be your output when running that script in Mathematica.
If you are using  MATLAB Compiler or builder products run:

.. code-block:: bash

 mbuild -setup

from MATLAB before using these.

Distributed Compute Server
