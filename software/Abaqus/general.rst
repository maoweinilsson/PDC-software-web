Abaqus is a commercial software package for finite element analysis. The Abaqus product suite consists of three core products: Abaqus/Standard, Abaqus/Explicit and Abaqus/CAE. Abaqus/Standard is a general-purpose solver using a traditional implicit integration scheme to solve finite element analyses. Abaqus/Explicit uses an explicit integration scheme to solve highly nonlinear transient dynamic and quasi-static analyses. Abaqus/CAE provides an integrated modelling (preprocessing) and visualization (postprocessing) environment for the analysis products.

Abaqus is used in the automotive, aerospace, and industrial product industries. The product is popular with academic and research institutions due to the wide material modeling capability, and the program's ability to be customized. Abaqus also provides a good collection of multiphysics capabilities, such as coupled acoustic-structural, piezoelectric, and structural-pore capabilities, making it attractive for production-level simulations where multiple fields need to be coupled.

Abaqus was initially designed to address non-linear physical behavior; as a result, the package has an extensive range of material models. Its elastomeric (rubberlike) material capabilities are particularly noteworthy. For more details, look at SIMULIA's web page:
