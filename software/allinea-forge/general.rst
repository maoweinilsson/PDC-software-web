Allinea MAP
-----------
Allinea MAP is a profiler that shows you which lines of code are slow and gets everything else out of your way.

Whether at one process or ten thousand, Allinea MAP is designed to work out-of-the-box with no need for instrumentation and no danger of creating large, unmanageable data files.  Software engineers developing parallel and threaded applications on CPUs, GPUs and Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors rely on Allinea MAP's unrivalled capability.
