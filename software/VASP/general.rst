The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is a computer program for atomic
scale materials modelling, e.g. electronic structure calculations and
quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics, from first principles.

Licenses
--------

VASP is not free software and requires a software license. 
VASP licenses are managed in `SUPR <https://supr.snic.se/>`_. 
All people who want to use VASP should have SUPR accounts and be a 
member of a VASP group in SUPR. VASP groups have owners, typically a 
principal investigator of a project, 
and that owner can add and remove people using the SUPR interface.
If you are Ph.D student, we suggest that you check with your supervisor.
