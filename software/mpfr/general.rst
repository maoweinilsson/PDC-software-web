The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding. 
MPFR has continuously been supported by the INRIA and the current main authors come from the Caramba and AriC project-teams at Loria (Nancy, France) 
and LIP (Lyon, France) respectively; see more on the credit page. MPFR is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.
