The CPMD code is a parallelized plane wave / pseudopotential implementation of
Density Functional Theory, particularly designed for ab-initio molecular
dynamics.
For more information see: http://cpmd.org

Note that there is a license issue about the installation for general users. According to the above website:

"Note that the CPMD licence is personal and not transferable and
is valid only for non profit purposes only."

This is the reason why we removed the module. Every user should have to install its own version of CMPD. The instructions on how to build the program can be found at https://www.pdc.kth.se/software/software/CPMD/beskow/3.17.1/index.html

COntact if you face any problems during the installation.
