# create scratch directory
# the default SCF directory is /cfs/klemming/scratch/${USER:0:1}/${USER}/gamess_scratch
# the default USERSCF directory is /cfs/klemming/nobackup/${USER:0:1}/${USER}/gamess_scratch
# but the user can override it by setting CUSTOM_GAMESS_SCRATCH
# NEVER point CUSTOM_GAMESS_SCRATCH to your home directory
# since the program might erase the scratch space after the calculation
# terminates
