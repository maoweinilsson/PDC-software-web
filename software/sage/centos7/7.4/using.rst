Running sage on an interactive node on Tegner
-----------------------------------------------

You can book a compute node for interactive running sage. The command to do this is *salloc* e.g. ::

 tegner$ salloc --nodes=1 -t 1:00:00 -A <project>
  salloc: Granted job allocation 2364
  salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
  salloc: Nodes t02n01 are ready for job

which will book one computer node (*t02n01.pdc.kth.se* for this case) one hour and *project* should be your projec name. And then from your local compute to login on the computer node and run sage using commands likes ::

 (open a new xterm on your local computer)
 local$ ssh -Y username@t02n01.pdc.kth.se #username/node should be changed to yours
 t02n01$ module add sage/7.4
 t02n01$ sage

Submit a sage job on Tegner
---------------------------

Letâ€™s use the following example for a sage job. The sage script called *test.sage* includes all commands will be run.

.. literalinclude:: files/test.sage
  :language: bash

And then creat a simple job script (e.g. *sage_run.sh*) which includes:

.. literalinclude:: files/sage_run.sh
  :language: bash

Submit it from Tegner's login node

.. code-block:: bash

 $ sbatch sage_run.sh

In this example, we requested one node for one hour to run the sage script. After finish the job, the result

.. code-block:: bash

 [x == -2, x == -1]

should be redirected to the file *my_output_file*
