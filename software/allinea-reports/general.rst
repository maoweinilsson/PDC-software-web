Allinea Performance Reports (APR) is a convenient tool to characterize and
understand the performance of HPC application runs.  It generates a clear
single-page HTML report answering the following questions: Is this application
well-optimized for the system it is running on?  Does it benefit from running
at this scale?  Are there I/O or networking bottlenecks affecting performance?
Which hardware, software or configuration changes can we make to improve
performance further.  For more information see:
