General observations
--------------------

Extrae is offered in two different flavors: as a DynInst-based application, or stand-alone application. DynInst is a dynamic instrumentation library that allows the injection of code in a running application without the need to recompile the target application. If the DynInst instrumentation library is not installed, Extrae also offers different mechanisms to trace applications.
